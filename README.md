# Advent of Clojure

As a way of learning Clojure I decided to try to do as many days from [this year's edition](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) of the Advent of Code.

> If some day is missing, I'll probably come back to do it later when I've got more time. I will also probably refactor some days as I learn Clojure better.

## Installation
